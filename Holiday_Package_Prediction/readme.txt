The problem is about holiday package prediction for a trips and travel company. The company aims to establish a viable business model to expand its customer base. Currently, there are five types of packages: Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King. Analysis of last year's data shows that 18% of customers purchased a package.
