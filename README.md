The project is related to “Algerian Forest Fire Dataset” which includes 244 instances from two regions of Algeria: the Bejaia region in the northeast and the Sidi-bel-abbes region in the northwest. Each region has 122 records. The dataset contains 11 independent features and one output attribute called "class."

The features include date, temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed (w s), rain, fine fuel moisture code (FMC), duff moisture code (DMC), drought code (DC), initial spread index (ISI), build-up index (BUI), fire weather index (FWI), and class. 

Our goal is to predict fire weather index (FWI) as the dependent variable using the other features as independent variables.

Have used Linear Regression.
